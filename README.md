Financial Aid Prediction System
Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning-based system to predict financial aid eligibility for students in higher education institutions. By analyzing historical academic performance, demographic information, and socioeconomic factors, the system helps institutions allocate financial assistance more fairly and efficiently. The model prioritizes transparency and interpretability, providing actionable insights to financial aid officers.

Features

Dataset

The system uses a combination of publicly available and synthetic student datasets, containing:

Academic records

Demographic information

Socioeconomic status

Scholarship eligibility labels
